An opening band is meant to excite the crowd and set the mood for the rest of the concert, and California-native indie-poppers [__The Colourist__][The Colourist] certainly did not disappoint when setting the stage for [The Naked and Famous][] at Terminal 5.

Accompanied by a spectacular light show that perfectly reflected their name, the band played all 4 songs from their first EP, [Lido][], that was released in August. They opened with their most well-known song, a number titled "Little Games" dominated by a lofty guitar hook reminiscent of the ones pervading [Walk the Moon][]'s recent work.

__The Colourist__ has already landed a wide variety of impressive gigs for such a new band. While focusing on live shows to build their fan base, the band has opened for established alt-rock bands like [Grouplove][], [The Wombats][], [Metric][], and [Atlas Genius][], a small Australian group that broke out in a big way to the music scene with a February album after gaining notoriety touring with the likes of [Silversun Pickups][] and [Imagine Dragons][].

Led by singer/guitarist Adam Castilla and drummer/vocalist Maya Tuttle, the four-member band manages to present beautifully polished melodies and thoughtful lyrics in a way that immediately captivated the audience at Terminal 5 and had the crowd swaying along within minutes. I found Maya especially impressive - it's rare to see a drummer that can pull off interesting, varied percussion while also harmonizing almost every note.

My personal favorite song, another tune with an electrifying guitar riff, soaring vocals, and a catchy chorus that quickly had the crowd singing along, is called "We Won't Go Home." The lyrics are a bit repetitive but the song's overall quality more than makes up for any shortcomings in that respect.

It's not often that I discover a new band which utterly blows me away. I like to think that I have a pretty varied and refined music taste, and I've been to enough concerts since coming to college in New York that I tend to have high expectations. But __The Colourist__'s opening act was by far the highlight of my night, and their short EP left me immediately wanting more. The band's effortless fusion of thrilling guitar riffs, memorable lyrics, and bright replayability makes them extremely accessible to any fan of the genre.

__The Colourist__ has quickly sprung from the void to become one of the groups I'm most interested in following the rise of in the future. Here's hoping that they receive the attention they deserve and keep producing such lively, engaging music going forward.
