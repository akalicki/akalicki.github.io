<p class="lead">Welcome to my personal portfolio!</p>

Over the past few weeks, I've done my best to design a clean and simple way of 
communicating what I've been up to and sharing my thoughts with the outside 
world. This website is intended to serve as a means of professional and 
personal contact, as well as a medium for me to express my ideas and talk 
about the things that I find interesting.

I have to say that I never really used to get the point of blogging - I guess 
I wasn't very comfortable sharing my thoughts in such a public format. But my 
feelings have somewhat come around since then. I'm beginning to think 
that creating some sort of public space to talk about my projects and ideas 
might not be such a bad thing. Even if nobody reads what I have to say, it 
will all be worth it if I'm forced to slow down and reflect just a bit more.

Although I'm launching the site today, it is still very much a work in 
progress. If you don't like the way something looks or have a suggestion for 
how I can improve my web presence I would love to hear from you! Please leave
