    <p class="lead">My name is Alex Kalicki, and this is my personal portfolio.</p>
    
    <p>I'm a sophomore in the <a href="http://engineering.columbia.edu/">Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science</a> at Columbia University and am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.</p>
    
    <p>I was born in New York City, but I grew up in Alexandria, VA and attended <a href="http://www.sidwell.edu/">Sidwell Friends School</a> - a Quaker institution located in Washington, D.C.  At Sidwell, I was lucky to be taught by passionate teachers who instilled not only a solid foundation and love for math and science, but also a strong appreciation for the humanities.  When not in class, I ran cross-country, played guitar for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/closedcamel/videos">my band</a>, and experimented with filmmaking and editing - culminating in an <a href="https://vimeo.com/5494472">award-winning video</a> featured on <a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>'s front page.</p>
    
    <p>Now I'm back in NYC for college.  I still draw (possibly too much) pleasure from a long tempo run, spend time working on my own <a href="#projects">CS and web-design projects</a>, and continue to enroll in diverse and challenging courses.  In my free time, I often can be found working on public outreach for the university's <a href="http://morocco.cuewb.org/">Engineers Without Borders Morocco chapter</a>, hitting the slopes as part of Columbia's <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/skiteam/">Ski and Snowboard Club</a>, leading groups of incoming freshmen on multiple day hiking and camping trips in the Catskills through the <a href="http://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/coop/">CO&Ouml;P pre-orientation program</a>, or taking a refreshing walk in Central Park.</p>
    
    <p>For as long as I can remember, I've been driven by an incurable fascination and enthusiasm for the outdoors, technology, creative expression, music, and innovation.  That same fascination drives me each and every day to extend my knowledge and expand my horizons.</p>
