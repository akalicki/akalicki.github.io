    <p class="lead">My name is Alex Kalicki, and this is my personal portfolio.</p>

    <p>I'm a sophomore in the <a href="http://engineering.columbia.edu/">Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science</a> at Columbia University and am currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Applied Mathematics.</p>

    <p>Last summer, I was thrilled to join the <a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a> team as a Software Engineering Intern working to redesign and simplify the company's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing">A/B testing</a> platform. I was ecstatic to get the chance to work closely with other developers on such an integral piece of software, used to evaluate and deploy new features to over 300 million users a month.</p>

    <p>I was born in New York City, but I grew up in Alexandria, VA and attended <a href="http://www.sidwell.edu/">Sidwell Friends School</a> - a Quaker institution located in Washington, D.C. At Sidwell, I was lucky to be taught by passionate teachers who instilled not only a solid foundation and love for math and science, but also a strong appreciation for the humanities. When not in class, I ran cross-country, played guitar for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/closedcamel/videos">my band</a>, and experimented with filmmaking and editing - culminating in an <a href="https://vimeo.com/5494472">award-winning video</a> featured on Vimeo's front page.</p>

    <p>Now I'm back in NYC for college. I still draw (possibly too much) pleasure from a long tempo run, spend time working on my own <a href="#projects">CS and web-design projects</a>, and continue to enroll in diverse and challenging courses. In my free time, I often can be found working on public outreach for the university's <a href="http://morocco.cuewb.org/">Engineers Without Borders Morocco chapter</a>, hitting the slopes as part of Columbia's <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/skiteam/">Ski and Snowboard Club</a>, leading groups of incoming freshmen on multiple day hiking and camping trips in the Catskills through the <a href="http://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/coop/">CO&Ouml;P pre-orientation program</a>, or taking a refreshing walk in Central Park.</p>

    <p>For as long as I can remember, I've been driven by an incurable fascination and enthusiasm for the outdoors, technology, creative expression, music, and innovation. That same fascination fuels my passion for learning and adventure each and every day.</p>
